## 🖥️ **Website Redevelopment**

  

This repository contains the source code for the development of [hunterstevenshaw.info](https://hunterstevenshaw.info/); my portfolio, built using _**npm create vite@latest**_. The new tech stack is designed for simplicity, performance, and ease of content management for future development and maintenance.

  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Overview** 
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

  

### 📘 **Frontend**

-  **ReactJS**: For building a dynamic, responsive, and component-based UI.

-  **SASS**: For styling with ease for CSS classes, maintaining a consistent and clean design for UI/UX.

  

### 📖 **Backend & Asset Management**

-  **NodeJS/Express & MongoDB/localStorage**: Storing images, email addresses, and other critical data as structured records.
  

## ❓ **Why This Tech Stack? (MERN)**


### **1. ReactJS & SASS/SCSS**

- Ensures modular and reusable code components for easy future updates.

- SASS/SCSS integrates seamlessly into React components, allowing consistent design & UI/UX.

- This is better for larger projects that have a lot of styles and makes sure they will be consistent. This also allows for better control instead of using styled-components where it might be overwritten or would not load correctly when components change.


### **2. NodeJS/Express & MongoDB/localStorage**

- Allows for storing data and info in a JSON type format.

- Ensures fast and reliable data retrieval and caches data once visited for the first time.

 

# 🗂 Overview to Project Setup

  

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.

- Create a React App _with_ Vite.

- Using this article, [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-in-2024/#:~:text=Create%20React%20App%20has%20been,new%20React%20project%20in%202024.).

- _**npm create vite@latest**_

### React + Vite
  
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
