## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Overview**

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,scss,firebase)](https://skillicons.dev)

### 📘 **Frontend**

- **ReactJS**: For building a dynamic, responsive, and component-based UI.

- **SASS**: For styling with ease for CSS classes, maintaining a consistent and clean design for UI/UX.

### 📖 **Backend & Asset Management**

- **Firebase Storage/localStorage**: Storing images, email addresses, and other critical data. This is great for faster load times and a better user experience.

## ❓ **Why This Tech Stack?**

### **1. ReactJS & SASS/SCSS**

- Ensures modular and reusable code components for easy future updates.

- SASS/SCSS integrates seamlessly into React components, allowing consistent design & UI/UX.

- This is better for larger projects that have a lot of styles and makes sure they will be consistent. This also allows for better control instead of using styled-components where it might be overwritten or would not load correctly when components change. This is also great for fast and easier styling. ReactJS is needed for my portfolio due to a lot of changing data/components.

### **2. Firebase Storage/localStorage**

- Allows for storing data and increases load/speed times.

- Ensures fast and reliable data retrieval and caches data once visited for the first time.

# 🗂 Overview to Project Setup

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.

- Create a React App _with_ Vite.

- Using this article, [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-in-2024/#:~:text=Create%20React%20App%20has%20been,new%20React%20project%20in%202024.).

- _**npm create vite@latest**_

### React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# ⚠️ **Issues**

# 🚨 Screen ratio for fake screens off on different screen sizes.

### ╰┈➤ Responsive Screens for iPhone/Desktop

- Screen within graphics needs to be the same on resizing.
- Responsive for both mobile version and desktop version.
